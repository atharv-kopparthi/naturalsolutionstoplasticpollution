          <p class="pagetext">Researchers in China and Stanford found that Mealworms(Tenebrio molitor) can eat plastic.You might have heard of the mealworm since it is consumed by humans as an alternative to meat and it has a very low enviromental impact on the planet.Tests were conducted in the lab and "100 mealworms ate between 34 and 39 milligrams of Styrofoam – about the weight of a small pill  – per day"-Stanford.Then the mealworms converted half of what they consumed into Carbon Dioxide.In the period of 24 hours the mealworms excreted the remaining plastic.The interesting part was that the plastic was fully biodegraded in the excreta.One of the researchers said that the excreta was safe to use as soil for plants.</p>

        <p class="pagetext">Microrganisms in their gut can break down polystyrene and styrofoam.These microrganisms are not new as they have been found in other insects. </p>
        <h2 class="subtitles">Why Has This Not Been Put Into Action ?</h2>
        <p class="pagetext">Scientists are still figuring and reseaching what are the best conditions and enviroments for these mealworms to eat the plastic so it can be implemented in the world.</p>
