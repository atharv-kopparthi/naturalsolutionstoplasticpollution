         <p>Just a heads up this larvae is similiar to the mealworm so there might be some information which might be identical.</p>

         <p class="pagetext">This discovery was by Federica Bertocchini.It happened when she was cleaning out her backyard beehive she found some waxworms in the hive and removed them,she put them in a plastic bag.After an hour she checked the bag and it had small holes in it.The waxworm is the larvae form of the small moth.</p>
  
        <h2 class="subtitles">Solving The Puzzle</h2>
        <p class="pagetext">Waxworms live in bee hives and feed of the wax from the beehive.Like plastic, wax is also a polymer that has a hugely similiar structure to plastic.Which is how the Waxworms evolved or adapted to eat plastic.Federica collabarated with her fellow scientists Paolo Bombelli and Christopher Howe to work out how the waxworms were eating plastic.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitles">Statistics</h2>
        <p class="pagetext">The team conducted research on the waxworms by placing them on polyethylene plastic.Each Waxworm can an average of 2.2 holes per hour.When they left the Waxworms overnight 100 waxworms degraded 92 milligrams of the polyethylene bag.</p>
